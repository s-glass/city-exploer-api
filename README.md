## Overview
Build a JavaScript applicaiton that will function as the backend to the city-explorer project. This backend app will use Cors and Express as middlewear; dotenv, and nodemon, and will be published with Render. The backend app will connect the front end to a second third-party API in which user-initiated requests will return weather data for a given City.
