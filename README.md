# city-exploer-api

**Author**: Sarah Glass
**Version**: 3.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Build a JavaScript applicaiton that will function as the backend to the city-explorer project. This backend app will use Cors and Express as middlewear; dotenv, and nodemon, and will be published with Render. The backend app will connect the front end to a second and third, third-party API in which user-initiated requests will return weather and movie data for a given City.

## Getting Started
- Set up server with dependencies express, dotenv, and cors
- Add data to weather.json
- Designate a port
- Create API endpoint /weather and Forecast class
- Retreive data with Cors, dotenv, and Express.
- Refactor weather endpoint to hit weather API
- Create another endpoint to hit movie API
- Retrieve API data with Axios
